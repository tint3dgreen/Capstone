# Introduction

[This section should contain background and introduction to your general topic.]

# Dataset

[In this section, desribe the dataset(s). This includes things like where you
obtained the dataset. Include a full citation, as specified 
[here](https://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=282964&p=3285995). Describe how the
data was obtained by the data owner/curator, as best as you can. List the 
variables that you plan to use in your analysis, for example:

* weight: The patient's weight (kg)
* sex: The patient's sex, male or female
* age: The patient's age (months)

]

# Data Acquisition and Processing

[In this section, if applicable, describe how you will obtain the data (if it's
anything more complicated than a simple download). Discuss what data 
processing steps will be needed, such as recoding variables, data cleaning,
data tidying, imputing missing values, etc. See sections 1c, 1d, 1e in the 
"Good Enough Practices" paper.]

# Research Questions and Methodology

[In this section, list each of the questions you will explore. Following each
question, provide a detailed and specific plan for how you plan to answer the 
question. Include the specific steps you will take, what form the answer will 
take (a number? table? visualization? model? Give all the specifics), and 
estimate how many hours each question will take to complete.]

1. Is smoking correlated with diabetes? To answer this, I will create a filled
bar plot, with the left bar representing non-smokers, the middle bar
representing people who smoke moderately, and the right bar representing heavy
smokers. The bars will be the same height, and each bar will be
colored two colors based on the proportion of patients in the group who do or
do not have diabetes.

2. Question 2? Plan for question 2.

3. Question 3? Plan for question 3.

4. etc.

# Work plan

[Fill in the list below with a plan for what you will do each week, starting 2/10. You should
have around 7 hours worth of work each week. Writing work counts. Several tasks
have already been filled in for you.]

* Data tidying and recoding (4 hours)
* Question 2 (4 hours).]

**Week 5 (2/17 - 2/23):**

**Week 6 (2/24 - 3/2):**

**Week 7 (3/3 - 3/9):**

* Presentation prep and practice (4 hours)

**Week 8 (3/10 - 3/16):** *Presentations given on Wed-Thu 3/12-3/13.*

* Poster prep (4 hours)
* Presentation peer review (1.5 hours)

**Week 9 (3/24 - 3/30):** *Poster Draft 1 due Monday morning 3/24 at 9am. Poster Draft 2 due Sunday night 3/30.*

* Peer feedback (2 hours)

* Poster revisions (1.5 hours)

**Week 10 (3/31 - 4/6):** *Final Poster due Sunday 4/6.*

* Peer feedback (1.5 hours)

* Poster revisions (2 hours)

**Week 11 (4/7 - 4/13):**

**Week 12 (4/14 - 4/20):**

week. The remaining time will be used for writing up and presenting your results.]

* Draft blog post (4 hours).

**Week 14 (4/28 - 5/4):**

* Peer feedback (3 hours)
* Blog post revisions (4 hours)
* [Do not schedule any other tasks for this week.]

**Week 15 (5/5 - 5/8):**  *Final blog post due Tues 5/7. Blog post read-throughs during final exam slot, Thursday May 8th, 8:00-11:20am.*

* Blog post revisions (2 hours)
* Peer feedback (2 hours)
* [Do not schedule any other tasks for this week.]

## Some cool Quarto stuff

[You can delete this section from your proposal.]

For your reference, here's an example of a Python code cell in Quarto,
along with a figure that gets generated, along with a caption and a label
so that it can be referred to automatically as "Figure 1" (or whatever)
in the writeup.

For a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Here's an example of citing a source [see @phil99, pp. 33-35]. Be sure the source information is entered in "BibTeX" form in the `references.bib` file.

# References

[The bibliography will automatically get generated. Any sources you
cite in the document will be included. Other entries in the `.bib` file
will not be included.]
