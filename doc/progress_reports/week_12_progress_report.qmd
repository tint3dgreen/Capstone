**Total \# of hours worked this week: [3]**


## What you accomplished (or attempted) this week:

This week I spent my time experimenting on layouts for the dashboard.

## Any setbacks/roadblocks you experienced:

This week I was facing some mental issues which made it difficult to sit down and get to work.

## What you plan to work on next:

Next week I want to have a working version of the dashboard so I can begin honing in on the design.

## Are you on track? If not, how will you get back on track?

I am behind. I will need to put at least 2 meaningful hours of work into this project each day this week.
