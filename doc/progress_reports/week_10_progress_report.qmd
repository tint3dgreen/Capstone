**Total \# of hours worked this week: [8]**


## What you accomplished (or attempted) this week:

This week I resolved the primary issue from my intermediate presentation. I was able to distinguish which neighborhoods were subsections of a larger neighborhood. The statistics from these neighborhoods were consolidated into one for visualizations.

## Any setbacks/roadblocks you experienced:

Procrastination was a major roadblock that caused me to work at very unreasonable hours in order to meed submission deadlines. Additionally the work was not of acceptable quality and needs to be revisited.

## What you plan to work on next:

Next week will be spend on revising the poster primarily. Secondarilly, I want to finalize the dashboard design with the hope to have it ready for the final poster.

## Are you on track? If not, how will you get back on track?

I am behind. I will need to put at least 2 meaningful hours of work into this project each day this week.
