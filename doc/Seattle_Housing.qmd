# Introduction

# Data cleaning
Once downloaded from the online dataset, the data was adjusted to replace all whitespace in column names with an underscore. This new dataset was exported for later use.
```{python}
#Import libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

#read in data from the original source
data_housing = pd.read_csv('../data/raw/housing_costs_Neighborhoods_-8848403750169343217.csv')
data_income = pd.read_csv('../data/raw/incomes_Neighborhoods_-1139681776900304943.csv')

# Replace whitespace in column names with an underscore
data_housing.columns = [x.replace(" ","_") for x in data_housing.columns]
data_income.columns = [x.replace(" ","_") for x in data_income.columns]

# Export data with column whitespace removed to interim data
data_housing.to_csv("../data/interim/housing_data.csv")
data_income.to_csv("../data/interim/income_data.csv")
```
