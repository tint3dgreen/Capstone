### Data
Adult.data<br>
### Notes
I dont like the hours worked per week graph. could use a regression line for better visibility

I still dont like how The only measure for slary is either above 50k or below 50k

Have you considered other models besides logistic regression? Perhaps SVM or decision trees?
6/10 - meh

Machine learning to predict volatility

Made a neural Network to predict valatility. His models appear to be very effective.
WOW did not expect the model to perform so poorly.

Whats the point of the project if the GARCH model exists and is good?
Very Ambitious
